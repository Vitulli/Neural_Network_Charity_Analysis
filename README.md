# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
### The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to Load, Build, Train, and Test, and optimize a neural network to help identify under what circumstances a loan will be successful.

### The first task was to load and train an initial model using two hidden layers:
- First Layer 80
- Second Layer 30

### The results were:
- Loss: 56%
- Accuracy: 73%
